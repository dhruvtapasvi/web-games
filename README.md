## Getting started

In this directory, run:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Editor

You should also install the [yarn editor sdk](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks) for your chosen editor:

```sh
yarn pnpify --sdk
```

I suggest using vscode. This project already contains some default vscode config, including suggested extensions.
